This module provides the webapp funtionallity for the Booosta PHP Framework. This is the "heart" of the
Booosta Framework, which in mainly designed for writing web applications.

Booosta allows to develop PHP web applications quick. It is mainly designed for small web applications.
It does not provide a strict MVC distinction. Although the MVC concepts influence the framework. Templates,
data objects can be seen as the Vs and Ms of MVC.

Up to version 3 Booosta was available at Sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/booosta/ From version
4 on it resides on Github and is available from Packagist under booosta/booosta .

This is an early development version which cannot be used yet. Get Booosta 3 from Sourceforge or wait for
a usable version. Sorry, there will be no (easy) upgrade path from Booosta 3 to Booosta 4.
